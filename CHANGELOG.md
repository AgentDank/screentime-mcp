# `screentime-mcp` CHANGELOG

## v0.0.1 (2025-07-25)

 * `screentime-mcp` is born!  :tv: :clock430: :robot:

## v0.1.0 (2025-07-26)

 * There are two main entrypoints to tweak this:

   * [Tool Description](./internal/mcp/screentime_sql.tooldesc.md)
   * [SQL View Creation](./internal/db/duckdb_views.sql)

  * We used Claude Desktop with `scrrentime-mcp` itself, along with human curation, to iteratively tweak those two files to improve its capability.
